        <h1>About Us</h1>
        <p>TMany children in underdeveloped or developing countries don’t have a legal name, so as they 



are not registered in the civil registry, their existence is not legally recognized.



At GiveMeAName, we want to change this situation creating a crowd-funding platform for 



long-distance adoption to give these children shelter, food, education and a legal name. With 



your help, we will be able to save a lot of lives.



For $5, GiveMeAName gives you the opportunity to propose a name for one of these children 



and explain why you want that name to be given. People who like this name can vote for it and 



donate so that one child can receive a legal name. This would be the child’s second name to 



reduce cultural issues and promote multi-cultural integration. 



When one name gathers $6000, which is the amount of money necessary to raise and educate 



a child from childhood to maturity, a child is actually adopted. An annual amount of money 



will be given to a no-profit organization to take care of the child and register him/her with the 



chosen name. 



Since the adoption, GiveMeAName creates a connection between donors and children, 



including in our web pictures, blog posts and videos of every adopted child.</p>
